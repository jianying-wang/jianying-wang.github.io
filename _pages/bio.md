## Past

#### Born: *Linchuan, Jiangxi, China*
This is where I was born and lived through my entire childhood before going to college. 
Linchuan (or the Greater Fuzhou Area where Linchuan is located), was home to a number of famous or less famous writers, 
philosophers and politicians in the history. The most famous one of them is probably [Wang, Anshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Anshi). For this reason,
Linchuan was also known by a nickname "Hometown of Talented", although I get goose bumps whenever hearing people mention
it ...

Jiangxi Province is located in the southeastern part of China. To its east are Fujian and Zhejiang. To the south is 
Guangdong. On the north are Anhui, Hubei. And to the west is Hunan. Sometimes when people ask where you're from, they
drill down to the question of where in China you're from, and I hesitate to answer because I doubt many people know
Jiangxi province. Most of the time people don't, but they're eager to share where in China they have been to, or 
some other geographical knowledge they have. Interestingly enough, after having lived in the U.S. long 
enough, sometimes when I hear people are from one state, I also ask where exactly they're from to get a sense of its 
relative location to somewhere else I have been to. And sometimes I sense people's hesitancy in answering my question 
as well.

#### College: *Beijing, China*
Well, most people know Beijing. This is where I spent four years of college at Peking University, and another two years 
being a "bei piao", working some side jobs and later in some Internet startups. I spent a significant portion of my 
first post-college year playing some online game called "MUD". It was probably the first virtual reality world (and the 
only one so far) I've encountered. Initially I literally thought there was a "virtual world" out there and curious what 
it was. Of course, later I learned it's just a bunch of people/kids typing in front of the computer. We constructed a 
world with texts and real hearts and emotions. It was a special period of my life. 

As I think back on some of the earliest days of bei piao right after graduation, I think it can be characterized by 
hardship, hardship that I didn't realize at that time, but somehow just powered through. I was too naive to even
recognize life's hardship. For one week I had to survive on 20 RMB, and I remembered I bought a pot and tried to cook
some tomato egg, but ended up burning the pot. The place I rented, inside or near the campus, was so wretched, that
they seemed unreal. But it was the reality then, for me and for a lot of others, and we seemed fine and survived. I
guess being young is the best capital we have, having no fear for anything.

##### Graduate school: *College Park, Maryland*
My first stop in the U.S. While my life up to college has been mostly smooth, every transitional step since then has 
not. Before college, I seemed to get everything without even trying. I just went to school and followed what the 
teachers instructed and got the best grades and went to the best college. After college however, at every step, I 
didn't get what I really hoped for or dreamed for. I kind of blindly tried, and ended up somewhere nearby. But
always stopped short of reaching exactly where I wanted to be.

##### Graduate school: *New Haven, Connecticut*
At Yale, I can sense the elitism in the air.

##### A short stay: *Chicago, Illinois*

##### Settling down: *Fayetteville, Arkansas*

## Future

This will forever be a mystery
Imagine what I will be in 10 years, 20 years, 30 years.
Imagine what the world is going to be like in 10, 20, 30 years.
