### Motivators

If you search for motivators, there are a lot of different taxonomies showing up in the results. One that I did not find
in the search results but learned about through some career coaching service lists the following 10:
- Meaning 
- Optimal health
- Time (flexibility, time freedom)
- Impact
- Visibility (prestige, recognition)
- Accomplishments (check things off list)
- Training (learning)
- Ease (easy and comfortable)
- Spending (money)
- Self-expression

I used to think self-expression would be the first thing to cross off the list for myself. But as I search for my next 
career move recently and start making this website, after putting up all the frame and structure, I struggle to find 
what I can display here (except for whatever is already on my resume). It was then it suddenly occurred to me, maybe I 
AM motivated by self-expression to make this website. When I think of this site as a channel to express myself, it 
suddenly becomes much more interesting.

### Now my actual biography

For a quick view of my professional career, simply download my resume, or go to my Linkedin.

For a more detailed history, I've organized my life journey by the places I've lived.

### Linchuan, Jiangxi, China
This is where I was born and lived through my entire childhood before going to college. 
Linchuan (or the Greater Fuzhou Area where Linchuan is located), was known by a nickname "Hometown of Talented", 
because it was home to a number of famous or less famous writers, phiolosophers and politicians in the history. 
The most famous one of them is [Wang, Anshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Anshi).

### Beijing, China
This is where I spent four years of college at Peking University, and another two years working in some Internet 
startups.

### College Park, Maryland

### New Haven, Connecticut

### Chicago, Illinois

### Fayetteville, Arkansas

### Seattle, Washington
