## Motivators

If you search for motivators, there are a lot of different taxonomies showing up in the results. One that I did not find
in the search results but learned about through some career coaching service lists the following 10:
- Meaning 
- Optimal health
- Time (flexibility, time freedom)
- Impact
- Visibility (prestige, recognition)
- Accomplishments (check things off list)
- Training (learning)
- Ease (easy and comfortable)
- Spending (money)
- Self-expression

I used to think self-expression would be the first thing to cross off the list for myself. But as I search for my next 
career move recently and start making this website, after putting up all the frame and structure, I struggle to find 
what I can display here (except for whatever is already on my resume). It was then it suddenly occurred to me, maybe I 
AM motivated by self-expression to make this website. When I think of this site as a channel to express myself, it 
suddenly becomes much more interesting.

## Past

Episode 1: On a Sunday afternoon, some teenage girl walking through a field, trying to reach the town center to 
catch the motorcycle-wagon ride back to the city for the school next week. She started to wonder, where she would be 
in a few years, or many years. She had no idea what to even imagine. Everything was purely blank. She just knew
there was a future there, something to hope for.
