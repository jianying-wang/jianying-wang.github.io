### Motivators

If you search for motivators, there are a lot of different taxonomies showing up in the results. One that I did not find in the search results but learned about through some career coaching service lists the following 10:
- Meaning 
- Optimal health
- Time (flexibility, time freedom)
- Impact
- Visibility (prestige, recognition)
- Accomplishments (check things off list)
- Training (learning)
- Ease (easy and comfortable)
- Spending (money)
- Self-expression

I used to think self-expression would be the first thing to cross off the list for myself. But as I search for my next career move recently and start making this website, after putting up all the frame and structure, I struggle to find what I can display here (except for whatever is already on my resume). It was then it suddenly occurred to me, maybe I AM motivated by self-expression to make this website. When I think of this site as a channel to express myself, it suddently becomes much more interesting.

### About me

I was born in a small state owned factory, where my parents worked, that was located in the suburb of a small city (Linchuan) in Jiangxi Province, China. Linchuan (or the Greater Fuzhou Area where Linchuan is located), was known by a nickname "Hometown of Talented", because it was home to a number of famous or less famous writers, phiolosophers and politicians in the history. The most famous one of them is [Wang, Anshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Anshi).

This small factory disintegrated in the 1990s in the great [state economic reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform). Both my parents were laid off, among millions of others. Since then we moved across several rental places in the city, during which my parents worked various jobs until their retirement. My childhood memories consist of sporadic moments across these different places, but it seems only the first one in that factory felt like home. I visited that factory sometime in the 2010s. All the buildings were still there, with grasses taller than me all around. There were even a few families who still lived there. It was a bizarre scene, a sharp contrast to where my husband grew up: he spent his entire pre-adult life in the same house in a northern village which was still there when I visited his family.

In the late 1990s, China drastically restructured its state-owned enterprises, privatizing some and shutting down others. The result: from 1995 to 2002, over 40 million jobs in the state sector were cut, along with nearly 30 million jobs lost in the manufacturing, mining, and utilities sectors.

Despite it looking like hardship, my family's economic background did not have much bearing on my growing up to the extent that I'm aware of. All around me people have similar backgrounds, so I didn't feel like I was any different from others. It was not until I was in graduate school in the U.S., when I was studying sociology, that I started to reflect on my family background and how it had impacted my life chances. Of course, it had a huge impact, but the exact impact all depended on what the control group is. Depending on which other variables are put into this multivariate function, I could be an outlier, or simply another data point on the predicted curve.
